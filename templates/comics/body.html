<!-- No html is required for "image only" comics.  -->

<!-- If your images follow the standard aspect ratio (1115px x 1443 px) of a page on a Superbook, you can also use <img src="" width="100%" height="100%"/> tag on your HTML. This is sometimes slower (obtrusive) than a background image depending on browser and Internet speed. -->
